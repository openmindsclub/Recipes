## :star: Now for the most exciting Part :drum: :star:
                Preparing Ur Easy Fast & Delecious meal  
                in 2 Steps ✔️✔️
     

### Fisrt Step : Cooking the Pasta :fire:
(Ezzzz you'll see):heavy_check_mark:

    1- fill the half of you're casrona with watter and add some oil to it and let it boil
    2- when it's done , drop your Pasta and let it cook
    3-you can easaly check if it's done cooking or not
    4 - if it's the case the next step is to filter it from water u will need a "kaskas" for this , it's better to "tchalahlha" at the same time
    5- your Pasta is good to go ! 

### Second  Step : Preparing the extra Stuff :shushing_face::shushing_face:

> ___Almost there_ . . .__ 

    __Our goal here is to prepare a 'sauce like' to add the extra taste to our Pasta

    let's get started ...

    
    1- slice Tomato , Onion , Tourchi, into square sahpe peices not too big or too small  .

    3- get youre "ma9la " under a calm fire,  put there somme oil ,let it heat up a bit and then add onoin fisrt  

    3 - wait for it a little bit (20 seconds) and then add tomatos & "tourchi" 

    4 - add some spices & salt
          *felel k7al 
                "basically it's the darkest one between all of them"
                
          * kamoune
                " it's brown like color he have like small "khachbat" in it "   

          * ras al7anout 
             "this one is tricky , just pick a yellow orange one and put it there "trust me on this". I can't tell you exactly how it feels or how it looks like cuz there are a lot of yellow ones and they all look the same , you'll need some experince for this xD
             "
          

1- Now you can increase the fire (closer to meduim ) 

2- It's prefered to cover youre "ma9la" with some "ghtiwa" to faster to coocking process 

and we wait :hourglass: & when it's done coocking ... 

>## Congratulations big Chef ! 
>you did dit !! :partying_face::partying_face::partying_face::partying_face:


*...now you can mix the two things that you prepared , add some cheez above if and... remember that **useless thouna** ,well not even more ;)*
